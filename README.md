Solidity smart contract to manage your legacy


## Why


## How it works

- User deploy contract 
- User manage heirs
- User manages when heirs can have withdraw the funds
- User deposits ethers
- User musts send an "heartbeat" regularly within a period of time that he set  - to not let the heirs withdraw his ethers
- If user doesn't send it after this period of time (counted with blocks) - any of the heirs (which can be a multisig smart contract) can take the ethers out.

- smartwatch/hardware integration
- network of servers which listen to the smart contract and send email/sms/etc when time is running out as warning
